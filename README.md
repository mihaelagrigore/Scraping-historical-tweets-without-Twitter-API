# Scraping-historical-tweets-without-Twitter-API
The tool I'm using here for scraping tweets: snscrape. Snscrape is a popular tool with social scientists for Tweets collection, at least in 2021. Apparently, it bypasses several limitations of the Twitter API. The prettiest thing is that you don't need Twitter developer account credentials (like you do with Tweepy, for example)
